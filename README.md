## 3D Printable Case

The case and pushbuttons are designed to be easily 3D printed from any standard 3D printer. I have made the .STEP files available as well as a .dxf of the PCB so you can modify the case or even design your own!

## How to Program ATMega328

Follow the guide [here](https://github.com/theprintablewatch/DIGIduino/blob/541a8b5c67f3c3e3cfa8df9d08a5a50cb2cadccd/Programming%20Guide.MD)

I have also filmed a short youtube video explaining how to program a ATMega328 seperate from the Uno more generally.

To program the chip on the PCB, follow these steps using the JST Jumper cable
